Description: 
        # DIMA
        
        A command-line tool to list, inspect and kill database queries.
        
        We've been using this tool since 2017 at Frame.io and decided to open source it. There will be a blog post with more details on the Frame.io Engineering Blog soon. Previous git history has been wiped by our security team.
        
        # Setup:
        
        1. Clone this repo
        2. Set up the credentials (see below)
        3. Run: `python setup.py install`
        
        (homebrew setup is being worked on)
        
        # Credential Setup
        
        Database credentials can be provided in 2 ways - in a `~/.dima_creds` file or as environment variables. DIMA will look first for the environment variables, and then to the creds file. You can set the following environment variables:
        
        	DIMA_DB_DBNAME
        	DIMA_DB_USER
        	DIMA_DB_HOST
        	DIMA_DB_PORT
        	DIMA_DB_PASSWORD
        
        or place them in a `~/.dima_creds` file (the prefix `~/` means that it should be in your home directory). A sample file `sample_creds` is in this repo. 
        
        You can add more credentials for different databases underneath, as long as they use a different prefix. E.g.
        
        	DIMA_DB2_DBNAME
        	DIMA_DB2_USER
        	...
        
        To inspect a non-default DB, use the `-c` option, e.g. for a prefix `DIMA_DB2_...` use:
        
        	dima -c DB2 show 123
        
        # Usage:
        
        	dima
        Shows a list of running queries
        
        	dima show [PID]
        Inspects a specific running query
        
        	dima rm [-f] [Lock / filter keyword / PID]	
        
        Terminates queries either with `wait_event_type` "Lock" or according to a filter keyword or PID. Use -f to avoid the confirmation.
